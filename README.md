> **A Deep Learning pipeline that perceives complex terrains and plans optimal trajectories in 20x20 grid environments.**

## 🚀 Overview

This project tackles the challenge of **autonomous navigation** in unstructured environments. Given a raw map image containing various terrains (forests, deserts, labs), the system must:
1.  **Perceive**: Identify walkable paths, obstacles (walls), hazards, start points, and goal points using Computer Vision.
2.  **Plan**: Compute the safest and most efficient path from Start to Goal.

The solution integrates **Deep Semantic Segmentation (ResNet-UNet)** with **Classical Graph Search (A*)** to achieve near-perfect navigation performance.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧠 Advanced Perception**: Uses a **ResNet34-UNet** architecture to segment 20x20 maps with high pixel-wise accuracy.
* **🏭 Synthetic Data Engine**: Includes a custom generator that creates thousands of synthetic training maps with realistic textures to overcome data scarcity.
* **⚡ Velocity-Aware A***: A custom A* implementation that handles variable terrain costs (avoiding hazards vs walls).
* **🛡️ Robust Inference**: Implements **Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)** (flips/rotations) to ensure stable predictions on unseen data.
* **🎯 High Accuracy**: Achieved **>99% pathfinding success rate** on the validation set.
